Description
- This project was done as a learning experience. I have minimal AI training and am currently only in Calculus II, so the methods used here will most likely not be the best methods out there. This was mostly done to see if I could create a neural network from scratch in a language that most people wouldn't use for it before I start using libraries like PyTorch. Based on this, I would say the project is a success.

Program Info
- The blue player is the AI. The AI has been tasked with avoiding hitting the red enemy (which moves randomly) but also to avoid hitting walls if possible. This means that for the AI to be perfectly successful it would have to never hit the enemy and never touch the walls.

Current Weaknesses
- to keep it from sitting still in a corner I rewarded it for maintaining a higher velocity, which I would prefer it to not have to do
- could still have improvements on dodging the enemy and not hitting the wall
